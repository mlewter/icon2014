ICON 2014 Demo App
=====================================

This application demonstrates an OAuth2.0 flow and simple calls against the Infusionsoft API.

It was built with:

    Play Framework (www.playframework.com) - a scalable Java framework
    AngularJS (angularjs.org) - javascript framework
    YAIL (https://bitbucket.org/dietsoda/yail) - a Java SDK for the Infusionsoft API

It is only necessary to install Play Framework in order to run this application

    1.  Install Play Framework
    2.  Fork the source
    3.  Update both the oauth.client.id & oauth.client.secret values in application.conf
    4.  Navigate to your icon2014 project directory
    5.  Compile the application: 'play compile'
    6.  Start the application using SSL: 'JAVA_OPTS=-Dhttps.port=9443 play run'
    7.  Navigate to https://<your local host>:9443/

*Please note:  you cannot use localhost as your domain.  Not sure what to do?

    For OSX, have a look at /private/etc/hosts
    For Windows, it might be c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts (I recommend asking google)

*WARNING:  This examples in this app are not intended for production use - but to demonstrate some of the
           concepts that were discussed during my ICON14 session.
